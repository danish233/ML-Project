# Machine learning project for CS 4774

Our main objective for this project was to develop a machine learning model to analyze the stock holdings of Virginiaâ€™s state and house elected officials in order to better understand what sectors and industries they favor. In doing so, our initial aim was to identify noticeable trends about which sectors were being prioritized by which political party and infer why these particular sectors were prioritized.
